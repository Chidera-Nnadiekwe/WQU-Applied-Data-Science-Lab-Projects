# Project 2
_______
## Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City 🇲🇽
### Overview
____
In this project, you'll explore real-world housing data from Buenos Aires, learn essential data wrangling and analysis techniques, and build models to predict property prices.

This project is structured into four (4) lesson notebooks followed by one (1) final assignment notebook.

#### Navigating the Lessons (Notebooks 1-4):
- **Interactive Learning:** Each of the first four notebooks is a self-contained lesson. You'll find explanations, code examples, and small tasks embedded directly within these notebooks.
- **Follow Along:** Read the text, watch the videos, run the code cells, and try out the tasks as you go. These lessons are designed to build your understanding step-by-step.
- **Lesson Task:** Most tasks within the lesson notebooks are for practice; simply complete them in the notebook. However, some lessons may include a few clearly marked graded activities. For these specific graded tasks, write and run your code, then click the **"Check Activity"** button for feedback.

#### Final Assignment (Final Notebook):
Once you have completed the four lessons, you are ready to begin the assignment. This is where you'll apply everything you've learned!

You'll see task descriptions and instructions on the left-hand panel. Your main workspace, where you'll write and execute your Python code, will be the notebook on the right-hand panel. For each task, carefully read the instructions on the left, then write and run your code in the corresponding cell on the right. After you've successfully executed your code and are happy with the output, click the "Check Activity" button (also on the left panel) to submit that task for feedback and confirmation. You can monitor your overall progress using the bar at the bottom of the left panel.

##### Important Notes for the Assignment:
- **One Task at a Time:** Focus on completing and checking each task before moving to the next.
- **Code Execution is Key:** Ensure your code runs correctly in the notebook before clicking **"Check Activity."**
- **Review Lessons:** If you get stuck, don't hesitate to revisit the relevant lesson notebooks for a refresher!
